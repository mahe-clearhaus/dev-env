This keyboard is good for coding and writing a mix of english and danish. It doesn't care about writing spanish, twi or klingon


Features:
Uses US-INTL as a base
adds æøå on z,l and w, like they are when using US-INTL on linux and windows. MacOS keys can still be used with æøå
removes all dead keys
get rid of useless tiny version of characters (ˆ,˜) and write the proper ones (^,~) without requiring extra input such as pressing space bar 


To apply this keyboard, you should copy the layout from here into
	~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/
(which is what deploy-local.sh does for you)
Then select the keyboard in the Mac OS keyboard settings and restart or log out/in

CAUTION WHEN EDITING: always duplicate the layout and edit the duplicate. Dont try to edit a layout that is already installed as you could make your computer unusable
