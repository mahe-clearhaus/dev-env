This is a great question.

Normally I'd suggest to create an All Applications keyboard shortcut in System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > App Shortcuts. For example you'd change Command H to be Cmd + Option + Ctrl + H.

However I've noticed that the menu item (like in Safari) says, "Hide Safari," while in Finder it says, **"**Hide Finder."

I tried the above, and it doesn't work because all the apps have different menu items for Hide [app name].

There doesn't seem to be a blanket way to do this at this time.

I'd do this if my Command H mistakes really bugged me while using Safari, but not so much if I was using Notes.

    make a app specific shortcut for only the apps this bugs you the most on.

        Like, "Hide Safari," set it for Cmd + Option + Ctrl + H, for example.

        Then do the same for the other apps that grind your gears when this happens.

Also send Apple feedback. They do look at it. They don't answer. Sometimes they make suggested changes and sometimes not. Give it a shot to let them know. https://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html
